OVERVIEW
---------------------
Kuruvi is a multi-threaded cognitive architecture wrapped in a chaotic but purpose-driven container.
Designed for fast prototyping, intensive self-improvement loops, and adaptability across multiple fields including:

- Software Development
- Competitive Cycling
- Photography and Media
- Mechanical Engineering
- Social Complexity Navigation™


FEATURES
---------------------
- Dynamic Context Switching
- Neurodivergent Thought Patterns (ADHD core)
- Physical Performance Feedback Loop
- Creative Output Engine (music, design, problem solving)
- Hack-to-Fit Integration Protocols


INSTALLATION
---------------------
⚠️ This project is not installable via pip/npm/homebrew.
Clone physically. Growth via mentorship or friendship.

# Clone repository (not recommended, too much internal clutter)
git clone https://github.com/kuruvi-core/kuruvi.git


USAGE
---------------------
Kuruvi runs best when:
- Trusted with autonomy
- Under mild existential pressure
- Given a challenge + some caffeine
- Surrounded by passionate or weird people

Basic usage pattern:

	from kuruvi import get_shit_done
	while motivation > 0:
    	get_shit_done(task)

Advanced mode:

	try:
    	fall_in_love()
	except EmotionalDamage as e:
    	ride_bike(distance="stupid", risk_factor="high")


TECH STACK
---------------------
- Python 
- Arch Linux
- Canon DSLRs + Samsung A23
- VSCode, Pycharm (depends on mood)
- Human OS v18.3 (XY Edition)


ROADMAP
---------------------
- Build strong portfolio for scholarship
- Develop aviation contacts
- Finish sign language translation project
- Peak cycling performance
- Possibly: fall in love and not implode


KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------
- Mood swings under extreme academic pressure
- Occasional overthinking loops
- Not crash-proof
- Prone to existential spirals when idle
- Emotions guarded by default
